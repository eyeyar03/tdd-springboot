### Commit Message Rules
- Prepend [Fail] to failing test commit message. Example: `[Fail] Add failing test for computing total cost for 2 apples.`
- Prepend [Pass] for commits that make the tests pass. `[Pass] Make the failing test for computing total cost for 2 apples pass.`
- Prepend [Refactor] for commits that refactor. `[Refactor] Create an enum for product instead of using constant.`
